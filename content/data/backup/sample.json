Routes are rules that map URL patterns to your content and\ntemplates. \n\nFor example, you may not want content tagged with News  to exist on: \nexample.com/tag/news. Instead, you want it to exist on example.com/news  . \n\nIn this case you can use dynamic routes to create customised collections of\ncontent on your site. It's also possible to use multiple templates in your theme\nto render each content type differently.\n\nThere are lots of use cases for dynamic routing with Ghost, here are a few\ncommon examples: \n\n * Setting a custom home page with its own template\n * Having separate content hubs for blog and podcast, that render differently,\n   and have custom RSS feeds to support two types of content\n * Creating a founders column as a unique view, by filtering content created by\n   specific authors\n * Including dates in permalinks for your posts\n * Setting posts to have a URL relative to their primary tag like \n   example.com/europe/story-title/\n   \n\nDynamic routing can be configured in Ghost using YAML\n[http://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html]  files. Read our dynamic routing \ndocumentation [https://docs.ghost.org/docs/dynamic-routing]  for further\ndetails.You can further customise your site using Apps & Integrations\n[/apps-integrations/].",
